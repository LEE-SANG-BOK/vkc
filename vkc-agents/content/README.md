# Content Publishing Guide (Weeks 1–4)

Structure
- Each week has day-level assets:
  - Shorts subtitles (SRT, KR/VI)
  - Cardnews CSV (for Canva/Figma injection)
  - Channel captions (KR/VI)
  - Day publish checklist (upload/verify steps)
- Weekly index files summarize all assets.

Flow (per day)
1) Create Shorts from script template + SRT
2) Generate 5 PNGs from Cardnews CSV (Canva/Figma)
3) Upload to platforms (TikTok/YouTube/IG/FB groups)
4) Use captions and UTM examples
5) Verify with the day checklist
